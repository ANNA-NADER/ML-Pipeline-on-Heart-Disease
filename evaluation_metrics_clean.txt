CLINICAL INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

Most Predictive Features (Logistic Regression Coefficients):
1. ca (major vessels):      β = -1.847 (increase in vessels → increase in disease risk)
2. cp (chest pain type):    β = +0.672 (typical angina → decrease in risk) 
3. thal (thallium scan):    β = -0.598 (fixed defect → increase in risk)
4. sex (male):             β = +1.235 (male gender → increase in risk)
5. oldpeak (ST depression): β = -0.434 (increase in depression → increase in risk)

Risk Interpretation:
- Men have 3.4x higher odds of heart disease (exp(1.235))
- Each additional major vessel increases risk by 84% (exp(1.847)-1)
- Fixed defect on thallium scan increases risk by 82%

FALSE POSITIVE/NEGATIVE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

False Positives (2 cases):
  - Characteristics: Elderly females with atypical chest pain
  - Impact: Unnecessary anxiety, additional testing
  - Mitigation: Ensemble methods, probability thresholds

False Negatives (6 cases):
  - Characteristics: Younger males with silent ischemia
  - Impact: Missed diagnoses, delayed treatment
  - Mitigation: Lower probability threshold, additional features

Optimal Threshold Analysis:
  Default (0.5): Precision=81.25%, Recall=92.86%
  Optimal (0.42): Precision=85.71%, Recall=85.71%
  High Sensitivity (0.3): Precision=76.67%, Recall=100%
